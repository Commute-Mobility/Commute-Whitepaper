## 🌿 What is Commute?
Our services.

### What service do we deliver?
Commute provides data-driven and scientifically grounded solutions to urban planners and policymakers to build, upgrade, and optimize transportation infrastructures for better livability. The goal of Commute is to develop and utilize state-of-the-art algorithms to enrich urban landscapes by conceiving networks that promote the organic coexistence of humans and transportation.

## ❓ Why Commute?
It is really that simple.

### Why the need for Commute?
Nowadays, urban transportation is becoming an environmental, societal, and economical burden for our lives. Car-centric cities, which are a result of decades of inadequate policy making, dominate the world. New technologies are continually implemented to find safer and more sustainable traveling solutions, but to create long-standing and revolutionary changes in the way humans connect, the problem of transportation should be tackled at its core—the design of transportation infrastructures.
To achieve such a change, we use a scientifically grounded and data-driven approach that allows us to reinvent modern-day transportation.

### Why you should choose Commute
1. **Commute prioritizes you.**
Our goal is to deliver human-centered solutions for transportation. This means that sustainability, safety and inclusivity are taken into account as main performance measures, while also guaranteeing travel efficiency.
1. **Commute is entirely research-driven.**
The solutions provided by Commute are scientifically grounded, and all our results are supported by a rigorous scientific evaluation. 
3. **Commute is different, it makes long-lasting changes.**
The idea behind Commute is to reshape human mobility at its foundation, the conception of the network infrastructure. This involves creating original network designs from scratch, revamping transportation infrastructures to achieve better livability (e.g. renovating outdated roads to meet optimality criteria), and optimizing traffic flows on existing urban networks.

## 🔭 Mission & Vision
Our goals.

### Mission
Our mission is to uplift the livability of cities by designing human-centered transportation. To do so, we aim to inform urban planners and policymakers with tailored algorithmic solutions for modern-day transportation networks.
### Vision
Our long-term vision is to empower policymakers with a powerful, reliable, and secure scientific framework that is able to automate the design of cities of the future. Our core values revolve around the concept of a human-centered urban landscape, where transport infrastructures organically integrate with our lives to aid sustainability, safety and inclusion, with the scope to enrich our societies. Our transportation solutions prioritize livability, as a shared condition of well-being for all.

## Redesign Transportation

## 🚦 Transportation Systems

Our goal is to provide assistance to policymakers and urban planners to build better transportation systems. For this reason, we present here a detailed guide on what they consist of **[WIKI, RODRIGUE]**.

### Definitions
**Transportation systems** are the combination of different **transportation modes**. A **transportation mode** is a traveling method that utilizes a specific kind of vehicle (a means of transport), infrastructure, operation, and policy. Modes can operate in air, water, and land, with land serving as our primary focus.

**Land transportation modes** are all land-based transport systems for moving people, goods, and services, which are essential for connecting communities. Land transportation plays a crucial role in urban planning, hence in shaping our societies.

There are two different types of land transport infrastructures:
1. **Rail networks.** Here a vehicle travels along two parallel steel rails that are referred to as a railway or railroad.
2. **Road networks.** Here vehicles utilize roadways. A road is a clearly marked path that connects two or more locations. Roads are named streets when they pass through urban areas, e.g. a city or a village, acting both as a route and as an easement for the use of the urban space. The set of streets builds the Street Networks.

### Transportation elements

1. **Means of transport.** Generally speaking, they can be either vehicles or animals. Vehicles (the primary mean of transport) are non-living devices that are used to move people and goods.
2. **Infrastructure.** This is the fixed installation that allows a vehicle to operate.
3. **Operation.** Private transportation is only governed by the vehicle's owner, who also drives the vehicle. Governments or private businesses conduct operations for both public transportation and freight transportation.
4. **Policy.** This deals with creating a system of rules which are developed to attain particular goals pertaining to social, economic, and environmental factors, as well as the operation and performance of the transportation system.

At Commute, we focus on empowering policymakers with scientific tools to create better transportation infrastructures where the operation of diverse transportation means is optimal.
