## 🌿 What is Commute?
Our services.

### What service do we deliver?
Commute provides data-driven and scientifically grounded solutions to urban planners and policymakers to build, upgrade, and optimize transportation infrastructures for better livability. The goal of Commute is to develop and utilize state-of-the-art algorithms to enrich urban landscapes by conceiving networks that promote the organic coexistence of humans and transportation.

## ❓ Why Commute?
It is really that simple.

### Why the need for Commute?
Nowadays, urban transportation is becoming an environmental, societal, and economical burden for our lives. Car-centric cities, which are a result of decades of inadequate policy making, dominate the world. New technologies are continually implemented to find safer and more sustainable traveling solutions, but to create long-standing and revolutionary changes in the way humans connect, the problem of transportation should be tackled at its core—the design of transportation infrastructures.
To achieve such a change, we use a scientifically grounded and data-driven approach that allows us to reinvent modern-day transportation.
