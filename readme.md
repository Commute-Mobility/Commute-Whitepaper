## üåø What is Commute?
Our services.

### What service do we deliver?
Commute provides data-driven and scientifically grounded solutions to urban planners and policymakers to build, upgrade, and optimize transportation infrastructures for better livability. The goal of Commute is to develop and utilize state-of-the-art algorithms to enrich urban landscapes by conceiving networks that promote the organic coexistence of humans and transportation.

## ‚ùì Why Commute?
It is really that simple.

### Why the need for Commute?
Nowadays, urban transportation is becoming an environmental, societal, and economical burden for our lives. Car-centric cities, which are a result of decades of inadequate policy making, dominate the world. New technologies are continually implemented to find safer and more sustainable traveling solutions, but to create long-standing and revolutionary changes in the way humans connect, the problem of transportation should be tackled at its core‚Äîthe design of transportation infrastructures.
To achieve such a change, we use a scientifically grounded and data-driven approach that allows us to reinvent modern-day transportation.

### Why you should choose Commute
1. **Commute prioritizes you.**
Our goal is to deliver human-centered solutions for transportation. This means that sustainability, safety and inclusivity are taken into account as main performance measures, while also guaranteeing travel efficiency.
1. **Commute is entirely research-driven.**
The solutions provided by Commute are scientifically grounded, and all our results are supported by a rigorous scientific evaluation. 
3. **Commute is different, it makes long-lasting changes.**
The idea behind Commute is to reshape human mobility at its foundation, the conception of the network infrastructure. This involves creating original network designs from scratch, revamping transportation infrastructures to achieve better livability (e.g. renovating outdated roads to meet optimality criteria), and optimizing traffic flows on existing urban networks.

## üî≠ Mission & Vision
Our goals.

### Mission
Our mission is to uplift the livability of cities by designing human-centered transportation. To do so, we aim to inform urban planners and policymakers with tailored algorithmic solutions for modern-day transportation networks.
### Vision
Our long-term vision is to empower policymakers with a powerful, reliable, and secure scientific framework that is able to automate the design of cities of the future. Our core values revolve around the concept of a human-centered urban landscape, where transport infrastructures organically integrate with our lives to aid sustainability, safety and inclusion, with the scope to enrich our societies. Our transportation solutions prioritize livability, as a shared condition of well-being for all.

## Redesign Transportation
A guide on the elements of transportation systems.

## üö¶ Transportation Systems

Our goal is to provide assistance to policymakers and urban planners to build better transportation systems. For this reason, we present here a detailed guide on what they consist of **[WIKI, RODRIGUE]**.

### Definitions
**Transportation systems** are the combination of different **transportation modes**. A **transportation mode** is a traveling method that utilizes a specific kind of vehicle (a means of transport), infrastructure, operation, and policy. Modes can operate in air, water, and land, with land serving as our primary focus.

**Land transportation modes** are all land-based transport systems for moving people, goods, and services, which are essential for connecting communities. Land transportation plays a crucial role in urban planning, hence in shaping our societies.

There are two different types of land transport infrastructures:
1. **Rail networks.** Here a vehicle travels along two parallel steel rails that are referred to as a railway or railroad.
2. **Road networks.** Here vehicles utilize roadways. A road is a clearly marked path that connects two or more locations. Roads are named streets when they pass through urban areas, e.g. a city or a village, acting both as a route and as an easement for the use of the urban space. The set of streets builds the Street Networks.

Other transportation elements are:

1. **Means of transport.** Generally speaking, they can be either vehicles or animals. Vehicles (the primary mean of transport) are non-living devices that are used to move people and goods.
2. **Infrastructure.** This is the fixed installation that allows a vehicle to operate.
3. **Operation.** Private transportation is only governed by the vehicle's owner, who also drives the vehicle. Governments or private businesses conduct operations for both public transportation and freight transportation.
4. **Policy.** This deals with creating a system of rules which are developed to attain particular goals pertaining to social, economic, and environmental factors, as well as the operation and performance of the transportation system.

At Commute, we focus on empowering policymakers with scientific tools to create better transportation infrastructures where the operation of diverse transportation means is optimal.

## ‚òÄÔ∏è Urban Transportation of the Future
This is how we envision transportation of the future.

We believe that modern-day transportation needs to meet 5 crucial standards for a livable and human-centered future:

The 5 criteria for livable transportation of the future.

### Sustainability

Since 1990, the constant increase in car ownership has steadily incremented Green House Gases (GHG) emissions derived from transport. These emissions peaked at 8.7 GtCO2e (Giga Tonnes of CO2 equivalent) in 2019, with 72% percent of transportation emissions coming from roads.
The EU is legally bound **[EU]** to meet Carbon neutrality by 2050. In order to achieve this goal, its interim emission reduction target for 2030 is to decrease the current GHG emission by at least 55%. The only solution for modern-day urban transportation to meet these goals is for them to reduce dependencies (and ultimately not rely upon) the world's natural resources such as coal, oil, and gas. Sustainable urban networks are crucial for the future of humanity.

### Safety & inclusivity
The Global status report on road safety **[WHO]**, launched by the World Health Organization in December 2018 shows that the number of annual road traffic deaths had reached 1.35 million. Road traffic crashes are the leading cause of death of people aged between 5 and 29 years.
Moreover, the current state of car-centric urban transportation is a major cause of societal inequality. As an example, in the U.S. people of color own substantially fewer cars (up to -14.5%) than white people **[US]**. Inadequate and scattered investments in public transport will only worsen the situation, and will not allow for achieving fair living standards for all.
In light of these data, modern urban transport needs to be made safe and inclusive for all.

### Efficiency
Our goal is to integrate the compelling obligations of sustainability, safety, and inclusivity into efficient transport. The two key steps to achieve efficiency by redesigning transport networks are:
1. reducing the need for travel by connecting people and infrastructures with improved urban design (e.g. creating hubs);
2. shifting from car-centric networks to infrastructures where bikes, pedestrians, and public transport are predominant means of transport. 

### Cohesiveness
A crucial constraint that our urban networks need to meet is Cohesiveness **[CROW]**. This concept can be operationalized into a scientific framework. It consists of the union of three desiderata:
Directness **[FOLCO]**: how far should a user travel to move from its origin to its destination with a desirable means of transport? This needs to be minimized.
Connectedness **[FOLCO]**: are users able to reach any destination safely? We need to answer this positively.
Robustness: is the transport infrastructure resilient to road jamming and breakage? We need to answer this positively.

### Economical Competitiveness
Recent studies **[SZELL]** show that cycling networks, which are a promising solution to unsustainable urban transport systems, need to (goal 1) be developed with the right growth strategy, and, crucially, (goal 2) be funded persistently while avoiding as much as possible scattered investments. To achieve these goals and to have a low economical burden on societies, at Commute we want to create a platform for making coordinated investments to improve the transport infrastructure as a whole, i.e. with several coexisting means of transportation.
