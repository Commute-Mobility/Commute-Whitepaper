## 🌿 What is Commute?
Our services.

### What service do we deliver?
Commute provides data-driven and scientifically grounded solutions to urban planners and policymakers to build, upgrade, and optimize transportation infrastructures for better livability. The goal of Commute is to develop and utilize state-of-the-art algorithms to enrich urban landscapes by conceiving networks that promote the organic coexistence of humans and transportation.

## ❓ Why Commute?
It is really that simple.

### Why the need for Commute?
Nowadays, urban transportation is becoming an environmental, societal, and economical burden for our lives. Car-centric cities, which are a result of decades of inadequate policy making, dominate the world. New technologies are continually implemented to find safer and more sustainable traveling solutions, but to create long-standing and revolutionary changes in the way humans connect, the problem of transportation should be tackled at its core—the design of transportation infrastructures.
To achieve such a change, we use a scientifically grounded and data-driven approach that allows us to reinvent modern-day transportation.

### Why you should choose Commute
1. **Commute prioritizes you.**
Our goal is to deliver human-centered solutions for transportation. This means that sustainability, safety and inclusivity are taken into account as main performance measures, while also guaranteeing travel efficiency.
1. **Commute is entirely research-driven.**
The solutions provided by Commute are scientifically grounded, and all our results are supported by a rigorous scientific evaluation. 
3. **Commute is different, it makes long-lasting changes.**
The idea behind Commute is to reshape human mobility at its foundation, the conception of the network infrastructure. This involves creating original network designs from scratch, revamping transportation infrastructures to achieve better livability (e.g. renovating outdated roads to meet optimality criteria), and optimizing traffic flows on existing urban networks.
